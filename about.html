                    My name is Lam Nguyen. Outside of the usual coding assignments from school, I really enjoy app development using Swift. Part of the reason is that it is quite similar to exercising where you combine everything you have learned and built into something that will personally impact you as opposed to my grades, as well as being able to implement some of my personal philosophies such as refinement and simplicity.

                    Outside of computing, I enjoy exercising in the gym or outdoors. I also am very keen on fashion and sneakers.
