                    Howdy! or Hello! My name is Lam Nguyen, and I am from Round Rock, TX. Outside of the usual coding languages and assignments from class, I am very interested in app development using Swift. 
                    The reason is because it is extremely rewarding seen how you can traverse and solve the addictive front end features such as UX and UI with back end components 
                    to create a meaningful project for yourself and others.

                    Outside of computing, I really enjoy fashion and sneaker collecting, and my favorite shoe owned ever would be the 1985 Jordan 1 Natural Grays. I also
                    really enjoy exercising as it feels very refreshing when hitting the gym.
