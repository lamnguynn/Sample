                    <p> I am a Sophomore Computer Science student at Texas A&M University. Currently I am interested in Native iOS Development and outside of that, sneakers and the outdoors.</p>

                    <p> My first app published. This app is written in Swift, and is designed to help me be able to plan my workouts for the day, as well as being able to get reminded tips for each exercise.  </p>
                    <p> <br> Features used: Core Data, Auto Layout, UICollectionView, UITableView, Animations, and UIStackView. </p>  
                    <p> <br> Lessons Learned: Reinforcement of Swift basics and applying it to a published app, as well as my need to better plan out my apps. </p>

                    <p> Following the same style as All Fit, this app is written in Swift, and is designed to help me be able to plan my assignments for the week, as well as be able to write down random notes. </p>
                    <p> <br> Features used: Core Data, Concurrency and GCD, UICollectionView, Animations, and programatically creating elements and constraints.</p>
                    <p> <br> Lessons Learned: Applying algorithm efficiency from class, as well as playing around with threads. I also was better able to plan better with tools such as Marvel. </p>
